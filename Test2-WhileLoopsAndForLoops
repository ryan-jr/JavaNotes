## Test 2 - Loops

### Section 1 - 1 to -x

```

```

```java
```


***

### Section 2 

```
Given int x = nextInt(), print the sum of the even numbers from 2 up to x. For instance, if x was 4 or 5, you'd print 6 (the sum of 2 + 4). 

```

```java
int x = nextInt();
int i = 0;
int sum = 0;


while ( i <= x ) {
    
    if ( i % 2 == 0 ) {
        
        sum += i;
        
    }
    
    i++;
    
}

println( sum );

```

*** 

### Section 3 - Multiply by 2

```
Given int x = nextInt(), how many times can 2 be multiplied together before it exceeds x? For instance, if x was 9, the answer would be 4 (since 2*2*2 is 8 and 2*2*2*2 is 16). 

```

```java

int x = nextInt();
int i = 1;
int sum = 0;


while ( i <= x ) {
    
    
    
    i *= 2;
    sum++;
}
println( sum );

```


***

### Section 4 - Print numbers divisible by 2 or 5

```
Given int x = nextInt(), print the numbers from 1 to x that are evenly divided by 2 or 5. For instance, if x was 10, you'd print 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10. 

```


```java
int x = nextInt();
int i = 0;


while ( i <= x ) {

    if ( ( i != 0 ) && ( i % 2 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 ) ) {
    
        println( i );
    
    
    }
    
    i++;
        
}
```

***

### Section 5 - Which sum is greater 

```
Given:
    int x = nextInt();
    int y = nextInt(); // y is >= x
    int m = nextInt();
    int n = nextInt(); // n is >= m
Determine the sum from x to y, and the sum from m to n, and print whichever is greatest. For instance, if x = 1 and y = 4 and m = 3 and n = 5, you'd print 12 (because 3 + 4 + 5 is greater than 1 + 2 + 3 + 4). 

```

```java
int x = nextInt();
int y = nextInt();
int m = nextInt();
int n = nextInt();

int sumX = 0;
int sumM = 0;

    for ( x = x; x <= y; x++) {
        
        sumX += x;
        
    }

    for ( m = m; m <= n; m++) {
        
        sumM += m;
        
    }
    
if ( sumX >= sumM ) {
    
    println( sumX );
    
} else {
    
    println( sumM );
    
}

```

***

### Lesson 6 - Print X factorial

```
The factorial of a number n, denoted by 'n!', means the product of all integers greater than 0 and less than or equal to n. For instance, 4! is 1*2*3*4, or 24. Given int x = nextInt(), compute x! and print the result. 

```

```java
int x = nextInt();
int i = x;
int sum = 1;
int ctr = 0;


while ( ctr < x ) {
    
    ctr++;
    sum *= ctr;
    
    
    
    
    
}

println( sum );

```
